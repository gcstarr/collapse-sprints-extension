# collapse-sprints-extension
A Chrome extension to help you navigate massive Jira board backlogs that have an absurd number of sprints: collapse all sprints, expand all sprints, and prefix filter them down when multiple teams share a Jira board.  Note: This extension works with Jira Cloud only. It is not compatible with self-hosted Jira instances (Jira Server or Data Center).
